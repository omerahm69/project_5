## How to use this repo

1. Fork this repo

2. In your forked  cherry leafs classifier repo click on the green Code button.

3. Then, from the Codespaces tab, click Create codespace on main.

4. Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.

5. Open the jupyter_notebooks directory in the explorer sidebar, and click on the notebook you want to open

6. Click the kernel button and choose Python Environments.

7.Choose the kernel that says Python 3.12.1 as it inherits from the workspace, so it will be Python-3.12.1 as installed by Codespaces. To confirm this, you can use `! python --version` in a notebook code cell.

## Cloud IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you, so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public, then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Business Case Requirements

General information:
The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods, a large-scale cherry plantation operator, is facing a critical issue with powdery mildew, a fungal disease affecting cherry leaves. The current inspection process is manual, requiring an employee to spend 
~ 30 minutes per tree visually analyzing leaf samples. If mildew is found, a compound is applied in 1 minute. Given the thousands of trees across multiple farms, this approach is unscalable and labor-intensive.

Client Overview:
The client aims to improve operational effeciency through automation. Pawdery mildew compromises not only the health crops but also product quality. Asimilar issue and process exist for other crops, making this initiative strategically scalable.

Business reqirements:
- Conduct a visual study to differentiate healthy cherry leaves from those affected by powdery mildew.
- Develop a predictive model that can classifies leaf images as healthy or infected.
- Provide a user-friendly dashboard for field use.
- Achieve a minimum model accuracy of 97% to meet success criteria.
  
Coventional Data Analysis:
Traditional data analysis can support the visual study by:
- Identifying visual patterns in infected versus health leaves.
- Highlighting key visual features (e.g., color distribution, texture features, and leaf shape)
- Providing explainable insighs into the model's behavior.

ML Solution
To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops.

Dataset: The dataset is a collection of over 4,000 cherry leaf images (healthy and infected), provided by the client and also hosted on Kaggle.  

 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and validation
Hypothesis:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can accurately classify cherry leaf images into healthy or Powdery Mildew categories.  

Validation Steps:
-    Use a balanced dataset with sufficient examples from both classes.
-    Track performance metrics such as accuracy and precision
-    Evaluate against a seperate test set to ensure generalizability.

## Mapping Business Requirements to ML Tasks

Requuirement 1 - Visual Study 
Mapped to Data Visualisations Tasks:
- Display class-wise mean and standard deviation images.
- Show the difference between average images of both classes.
- Present image montages to visualize variation. 

Requirement 2 - Prediction
Mapped to ML Tasks:
- Train a binary classifier (Healthy vs. Powdery Mildew).
- Generate classification reports and evaluate with metrics.
- Deploy predictions through a web-based dashboard.

## ML Business Case
We want an ML model to predict if an image is healthy or not based on historical image data. It is a supervised binary classification model that predicts whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected.
The output includes:
-    A classification label
-    Associated probability/confidence score.

Success Metric:
The client consider a succeful project outcome as:
-  A study showing how to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is helathy form pwdery mildew
-  The capability of the model to predict if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew 

Ethical and Privacy Considerations:
- The client provided the data under an NDA (non-disclosure agreement),
- The data should only be shared with professionals that are officially involved in the project.

Project Breakdown
Epics and User Stories
1. Information Gathering and Data Collection
   - As a data scintist, I need access to labeled leaf images to train and test the model.
3. Data Visualization, Cleaning and Preparation
   - As a data analyst, I want to explore visual differencies to assist in the visual study.
4. Model Training and Visulaization
   - As an ML engineer, I want to train a binary classifier to distinguish leaf health status.
5. Dashboard Development
    - As a frontend developer, I want to design and build an intuitive dashboard.
7. Deployment and Release
   - As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy thedashboard securely and reliably

Business Benefit:
-    Reduce inspection time from 30 minutes to seconds per tree.
-    Prevent supply chain contamination with compromised produce.
-    Enable future cross-crop scalability for other fungal or pest infections.
